# World-Happiness

The economics of happiness has been vastly studied since the beginning of the 20th century and various factors have been identified that help explain happiness index. With an increase in social awareness and concern across the world, topics such as mental health and happiness of individuals have become important factors in various fields of research. For this study, we use ‘The World Happiness’ data set from Kaggle. This project helps to understand happiness across the world. The data set provides information about some economic and social factors which can estimate the happiness scores. The main goal of the project is to visually explore happiness scores across the world and to understand which factors play major role in altering happiness scores. Such an understanding can form a basis for informed and effective policy-making around the world. I plan to visually analyze the information provided in this dataset to form an understanding about the factors which have a high correlation with happiness scores across the world.
